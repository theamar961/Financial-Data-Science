<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Over the past couple of months, I have been thoroughly intrigued by the world of finance. The data science community can add a lot of value to the financial domain. 

### Part 1 

In this notebook, I am investigating some of the metrics used to evaluate a stock. In my first attempt to model or program the financial world, we will analyze a stock based on volume.

### Part 2

Adani Power has been in the news for the last dozen weeks. A security whose price has gone up purely based on speculation and hype - finally was called out upon. In this notebook, I have analyzed some of the key metrics and timelines that reflect the audacious rise of this security.
